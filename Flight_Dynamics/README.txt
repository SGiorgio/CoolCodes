Hi,In this folder you'll find some useful stuff that automatize some boring processes, needed for Flight Dynamics exercises.Since I discovered (in the hard way) that using _ or - in the code name brings to syntax error on the cg50. I named my programs in an ugly, still efficient way.Every program is lightly commented, but don't expect to find notions of theory (learn them on your own :P).(Orbital Dynamics convertions)XXXSS2FF.pyXXX: Orbit's TypeSS:  Input: this is not the only input required but identifies the way to go through the flight dynamics quantities.2: stands for "to", to lazy to write "to" (ironic) FF:  Output: the quantity given as output############LEGEND:Eps: EllipticsPrb: ParabolicsHpb: Hyperbolicstt : timeTA : True AnomalyIf you are reading this, you have my full respect and my Telegram contact @Sanghuol where you can express your opinions, doubts, congratulations regarding my work.
